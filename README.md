# **Energy Management System made in OOP class Using C++ **

This repository contains the source code for a progressive energy management system developed as part of university lab tasks. The project simulates energy consumption and costs for households, evolving incrementally across six versions (`A1` to `A6`).

## **Overview**

The system tracks energy usage and costs for households and their devices (consumers and producers). Each version introduces new features or improves existing ones, showcasing progressive software development.

## **Progression**

The project builds step by step across six stages:

- **`A1`**: Basic implementation of devices and households.
- **`A2`**: Introduction of specific device types (`Mobile`, `Immobile`, `Solar`).
- **`A3`**: Dynamic device management using a linked list.
- **`A4`**: Advanced operations like reordering and copying devices.
- **`A5`**: File input/output for data persistence.
- **`A6`**: Final integration of all features in a menu-driven application.

## **Features**

### **Device Management**
- Add and remove devices dynamically.
- Calculate annual energy consumption and costs.
- Support for multiple device types (`Mobile`, `Immobile`, `Solar`).

### **Household Management**
- Track household details such as:
  - Square meters.
  - Number of residents.
  - Water heating (electric or not).
- Manage multiple households within a house.

### **File I/O**
- Save and load house and household data.
- Use customizable delimiters for file formats.

### **Dynamic Operations**
- Reorder devices within a household.
- Copy devices between households.

### **User-Friendly Interface**
- Interactive, menu-driven console application.

## **How It Works**

Users interact with the application through a menu to perform various tasks:

1. **Initialize a house**: Create a house with multiple households and set its address.
2. **Manage households**: Add, remove, or edit households.
3. **Add devices**: Include `Mobile`, `Immobile`, or `Solar` devices.
4. **View reports**: Print details for individual households or all households.
5. **Persist data**: Save or load the program state to/from a file.
6. **Reorder or copy devices**: Organize and duplicate devices as needed.

## **How to Run**


## **Conclusion**

This project highlights incremental software development, showcasing how object-oriented programming principles can be applied to solve real-world problems. It serves as a practical learning tool for progressive coding and system design.
